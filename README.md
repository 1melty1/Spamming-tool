# Spamming-tool

It basically automatically types your designated messages and press enter. Then the message will be sent.

Nothing special, very primitive.

Need to install pynput.

Functions provided :
- random or fixed time spacing of sending messages
- sending messages in random ( mixing original and inverted messages ) or only original
- unlimited messages variation
- running in the background, start spamming when ` key pressed
